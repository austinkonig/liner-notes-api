# Liner Notes API

Welcome to the Liner Notes API, a backend for uploading and downloading files from the Liner Notes userbase.

Liner Notes is meant to solve an age-old problem behind searching for samples, particularly in forums such as Reddit that may have invalid links, deleted drum packs, etc.

This repository is my first official project on GitHub and is a demo of what this site will offer in a final build.

Through Liner Notes, I'm using mern learning resources from Adrian Hajdin, of JS Mastery. For more information on JS Mastery's web development guides, please visit Hajdin's Github at https://github.com/adrianhajdin.

## Getting Started

To get started with Liner Notes API, you can follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command: git clone https://github.com/austinkonig/liner-notes-api

2. **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies for both the frontend and backend components.
- NOTE: If you see an error starting with "Error: error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported...", please visit this forum for information on how to fix it:

3. **Run the Application:** Launch the API locally, using whatever proxy or host you'd like. For now, this uses yarn for adding dependencies. For this API, I used MongoDB as my database.
